# hello-intern
exploration of Intern for testing ArcGIS applications

Setup
* npm install
* run tests via browser, e.g. http://localhost/~jcc/hello-intern/node_modules/intern/client.html?config=tests/intern

console-based tests don't seem to work, e.g. ./node_modules/.bin/intern-client config=tests/intern
